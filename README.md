# MMA Math App
An app that finds a path of victories connecting two fighters. Not to be taken seriously

## Overview
The MMA Math App allows users to explore connections between fighters based on wins, recreating the often debated but flawed "MMA Math" logic. Given two fighters, the app finds a path of victories linking the first fighter to the second, if one exists.

## Try It Out

## How To
Select Fighters: Use the search function to select a starting fighter and an ending fighter.
###
Find the Path: Click "Find Path" to begin. The app will start with fighters the starting fighter has beaten, then recursively move through each fighterâ€™s victories until reaching the end fighter.
###
View Results: If a path exists, the app will display it, highlighting each step from the starting to the ending fighter.

###
The app is inspired by the "MMA Math" concept found in online MMA communities, which assumes that if one fighter beats another, they should theoretically be able to defeat anyone the other fighter has beaten. This transitive logic is in reality flawed, as fighting skill is not measured as a one-dimensional trait. Styles and matchups matter.

This app pushes "MMA Math" to its most absurd extent by linking fighters through win paths across multiple connections, allowing users to connect nearly any two fighters with UFC wins. Use it whether you want to "prove" a fighter's superiority or just have fun exploring connections.
