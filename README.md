# MMA Math App

An app that can connect two fighters through wins. To be used for silliness

## How To

(https://mnguyen26.github.io/mmamathapp/)

Search for and select your first fighter whose wins we will start off with. Do the same for a second fighter who will be the end. When you click the "Find Path" button, the app will start with fighters the starting fighter has beaten and then do the same for that set of fighters recursively until the end fighter is found.

### 

This project was inspired by what the online MMA community refers to as "MMA Math", which often does not turn out to work in real life. The basic premise is assuming that one fighter's win over another would make the first fighter the favorite to win in a fight against anyone who the second fighter has defeated. In other words, it assumes a transitive property of wins; if you beat him, and I beat you, I should beat him. This, in fact, often does not work because wins are not transitive and fighting ability is not measured as a one-dimensional trait. There is an element of randomness but styles really do make fights and matchups matter in determining the outcome of a fight. However, "MMA math" is still used all the time by individuals to guess the outcomes of fights.

This project takes MMA math to its farthest and most absurd extent but making multiple leaps in logic through multiple wins. It will attempt to find the win path between any two fighters that you enter. As long as a fighter has at least one win in the UFC, it's very likely you will be able to connect them to another fighter with at least one loss in the UFC. Thus, you can very easily say any particular fighter of your liking is better than another that is of your dis...liking.



# MMA Math App
An app that finds a path of victories connecting two fighters. Not to be taken seriously

## Overview
The MMA Math App allows users to explore connections between fighters based on wins, recreating the often debated but flawed "MMA Math" logic. Given two fighters, the app finds a path of victories linking the first fighter to the second, if one exists.

## Try It Out
Check out the app here: (https://mnguyen26.github.io/mmamathapp/)

## How To
Select Fighters: Use the search function to select a starting fighter and an ending fighter.
Find the Path: Click "Find Path" to begin. The app will start with fighters the starting fighter has beaten, then recursively move through each fighterâ€™s victories until reaching the end fighter.
View Results: If a path exists, the app will display it, highlighting each step from the starting to the ending fighter.

###
The app is inspired by the "MMA Math" concept found in online MMA communities, which assumes that if one fighter beats another, they should theoretically be able to defeat anyone the other fighter has beaten. This transitive logic is in reality flawed, as fighting skill is not measured as a one-dimensional trait. Styles and matchups matter.

This app pushes "MMA Math" to its most absurd extent by linking fighters through win paths across multiple connections, allowing users to connect nearly any two fighters with UFC wins. Use it whether you want to "prove" a fighter's superiority or just have fun exploring connections.
